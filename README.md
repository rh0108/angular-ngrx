# OnlineStore

In order to show how to use @ngrx/store in Angular. To demonstrate the power of @ngrx/store, I built a simple "online store", that will allow users to do the following:

*See a list of products
*View a particular product
*Users can add a product to their cart
*Users can delete a product from their cart

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
